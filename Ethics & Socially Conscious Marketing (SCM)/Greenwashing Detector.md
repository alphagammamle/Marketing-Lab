# Greenwashing Detector

## Overview
Students compare two or more sustainability-focused advertisements or brand claims to determine whether they represent legitimate environmental action or misleading greenwashing.  
The activity helps students critically evaluate sustainability messages and understand how brands use environmental cues to influence consumer perception.

## Learning Objectives
- Identify common types of greenwashing and misleading sustainability claims.
- Evaluate the credibility of environmental marketing messages.
- Apply frameworks for ethical communication and corporate responsibility.
- Develop critical thinking skills for assessing sustainability information.

## Materials
- Two to four sustainability-themed ads or product packages (printed or digital)
- Greenwashing checklist or rubric
- Worksheet for scoring evidence and credibility
- Projector or shared screen for examples

## Preparation
1. Select a set of real ads that vary in how credible their environmental claims are.  
2. Prepare a simple checklist that includes dimensions such as:
   - Specificity of claims  
   - Evidence provided  
   - Third-party certifications  
   - Transparency about impact  
   - Visual vs factual cues  
3. Provide a short introduction to types of greenwashing:
   - Vague or unsubstantiated claims  
   - Hidden trade-offs  
   - Irrelevant claims  
   - Fictional labels  
   - Overstated impact  

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Explain what greenwashing is and show a few quick examples.  
Discuss why sustainability communication is both important and prone to misuse.

### Step 2 – Analysis (10–30 min)
In small groups, students review assigned ads and complete the rubric:
- What sustainability claims are being made?  
- Are the claims specific or vague?  
- Is any evidence or certification provided?  
- Do visuals imply environmental benefits not supported by facts?  
- Are trade-offs disclosed?  

### Step 3 – Scoring and Comparison (30–45 min)
Groups assign a credibility score to each ad using the rubric.  
Discuss differences in scoring between groups and what influenced their judgment.

### Step 4 – Class Debrief (45–60 min)
Discuss:
- Which ads were most credible and why  
- Which cues were misleading  
- How companies use color, imagery, and tone to imply sustainability  
- Why consumers struggle to distinguish real sustainability efforts from marketing spin

## Reflection Prompt
“Which environmental claim did you find most convincing or most misleading? What criteria did you use to decide?”

## Optional Extensions
- Redesign a misleading ad into a transparent, evidence-based version.  
- Apply the checklist to packaging in a local store.  
- Compare sustainability reports from two companies in the same industry.
