# Shoppable Video Lab

## Overview
Students design a short interactive video concept that mimics a shoppable social media post.  
The activity helps students understand how **interactive content**, **calls-to-action**, and **commerce features** influence engagement and purchase behavior on platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube Shorts.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how shoppable media integrates content and commerce.
- Identify design elements that increase engagement and conversion.
- Create a storyboard for a short shoppable video including CTAs and product cues.
- Evaluate the strategic role of short-form video in the customer journey.

## Materials
- Smartphones or laptops  
- TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, or Canva (free version)  
- Storyboard template (paper or digital)  
- Example shoppable videos (optional)

## Preparation
1. Prepare 2–3 examples of real shoppable videos from major brands or influencers.  
2. Provide a short introduction on:
   - What makes content clickable  
   - Placement of call-to-action elements  
   - How product cues are embedded in the narrative  
3. Prepare a simple storyboard worksheet:  
   - Frame  
   - Visual description  
   - Audio/script  
   - CTA placement  
   - Product feature highlighted  

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
- Show examples of shoppable video formats.  
- Define what counts as “shoppable”: clickable tags, product overlays, pinned comments, or links.  
- Explain how shoppable videos reduce friction between discovery and purchase.

### Step 2 – Planning (10–25 min)
Teams choose:
- A product  
- A target customer  
- A platform (TikTok, Instagram, or YouTube)

They outline:
- Key message  
- Tone and visual style  
- Specific call-to-action (e.g., “Shop Now,” product tag, swipe-up equivalent)

### Step 3 – Storyboarding (25–45 min)
Teams create a storyboard for a 10–20 second video.  
Each frame should note:
- Camera angle or visual shot  
- On-screen text  
- Product appearance  
- CTA timing  
- Audio, voiceover, or sound cues  

Optional: Students may record a rough prototype using their phones.

### Step 4 – Presentation (45–60 min)
Each group presents their concept in 2–3 minutes.  
Class discusses:
- What made the content engaging  
- How effectively the product was integrated  
- Whether the CTA was clear and well-timed  
- Whether the message matched platform norms

## Debrief
Discuss strategic insights:
- Why short-form video is effective for awareness and conversion  
- How interactivity shortens the path to purchase  
- Ethical considerations in persuasive short-form content  

## Reflection 
“What elements of your video design were most important for driving engagement or purchase? Which platform features shaped your creative decisions?”
