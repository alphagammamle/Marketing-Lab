# Targeting Matrix Lab

## Overview
Students evaluate multiple market segments for a real brand using a structured **targeting matrix**.  
By scoring segments on clear criteria, students learn how targeting decisions are made systematically rather than intuitively.

The activity emphasizes **trade-offs**, **prioritization**, and **evidence-based targeting**.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how firms evaluate and select target segments.
- Apply targeting criteria such as size, growth, accessibility, and profitability.
- Compare and justify targeting decisions using a structured framework.
- Recognize the difference between attractive segments and strategically appropriate targets.

## Materials
- Targeting matrix worksheet (paper or spreadsheet)
- Short brand or market case (real or simplified)
- Pen, whiteboard, or shared document for discussion

## Preparation
1. Choose a familiar brand or product category (e.g., sportswear, coffee chains, smartphones).
2. Identify 3–5 potential customer segments (e.g., students, professionals, families).
3. Prepare a simple matrix with rows = segments and columns = criteria:
   - Segment size  
   - Growth potential  
   - Accessibility / reachability  
   - Profitability  
   - Strategic fit  

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Briefly review the STP framework:
- Segmentation  
- Targeting  
- Positioning  

Explain that targeting requires **comparison across segments**, not absolute judgment.

### Step 2 – Segment Understanding (10–20 min)
In groups, students review the brand and segment descriptions:
- Who is the customer?  
- What are their needs and behaviors?  
- Why might this segment be attractive?

### Step 3 – Matrix Scoring (20–40 min)
Groups score each segment on each criterion (e.g., 1–5 scale).  
They must justify every score using logic, assumptions, or provided data.

Example matrix structure:

Segment | Size | Growth | Accessibility | Profitability | Strategic Fit | Total
--------|------|--------|---------------|---------------|----------------|-------
Segment A | | | | | |
Segment B | | | | | |
Segment C | | | | | |

### Step 4 – Target Selection (40–55 min)
Groups:
- Rank segments by total score  
- Select one primary target segment  
- Optionally identify a secondary target  

They prepare a short justification:
- Why this segment?  
- What trade-offs were accepted?

### Step 5 – Class Discussion (55–65 min)
Compare group decisions:
- Did different groups choose different targets?  
- Which criteria mattered most?  
- Were any high-scoring segments rejected? Why?

## Debrief
Discuss key insights:
- Targeting is relative, not absolute.  
- A large segment is not always the best target.  
- Strategic fit and accessibility often matter more than size alone.

Link to positioning:
- Once a target is chosen, positioning decisions become clearer and more focused.

## Reflection Prompt
“Which criterion influenced your targeting decision the most, and why? What would change if the company’s strategy or resources were different?”

## Optional Extensions
- Weight criteria differently to reflect different strategies.  
- Add real market data to replace assumptions.  
- Link the chosen target to a positioning statement or value proposition.
