# VR Store Walkthrough

## Overview
Students explore a virtual retail environment using VR videos, 360-degree store tours, or online walkthroughs.  
The activity demonstrates how **store layout, spatial design, immersion, and visual cues** influence perceived control, engagement, and purchase intentions.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how spatial layout shapes shopping behavior.
- Identify immersive design elements that influence attention, emotion, and flow.
- Connect virtual retail experiences to physical retail design principles.
- Evaluate how immersion affects perceived value and purchase likelihood.

## Materials
- VR store video or 360-degree walkthrough (YouTube 360, Shopify AR/VR demos, or virtual mall tours)
- Laptop or smartphone
- Optional: Google Cardboard or simple VR viewers
- Observation worksheet

## Preparation
1. Choose a VR or 360° store walkthrough. Examples:
   - YouTube 360 virtual retail tours  
   - Grocery store 360° interiors  
   - Virtual fashion stores on Shopify  
2. Prepare an observation sheet covering:
   - Layout and navigation  
   - Lighting and color  
   - Product visibility  
   - Movement flow  
   - Emotional response  
3. Explain core concepts:
   - Store atmospherics  
   - Immersion and presence  
   - Approach–avoidance behavior  

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Explain what makes a store immersive:
- Spatial realism  
- Smooth navigation  
- Clear product cues  
- Sensory richness (visual / auditory)  

Introduce the goal: to analyze how spatial and design elements influence shopper feelings and behavior.

### Step 2 – VR Walkthrough (10–25 min)
Students individually or in groups explore the virtual store and note:
- How easy or difficult it is to navigate  
- Which products draw attention and why  
- Moments where immersion increases or breaks  
- Emotional reactions (comfort, excitement, confusion, etc.)  

### Step 3 – Analysis Discussion (25–45 min)
Groups share observations:
- What layout features worked best (aisle flow, focal points, signage)?  
- How did lighting or color guide attention?  
- Did the VR environment feel realistic? Why or why not?  
- What could be improved for better engagement or conversion?

### Step 4 – Application (45–60 min)
Students propose one improvement to the VR store to enhance:
- Shopper flow  
- Product visibility  
- Immersion  
- Purchase intent  

Optional: have students sketch a redesigned layout.

## Reflection Prompt
“How did the virtual layout and design influence your attention and behavior? What design change would most improve the experience?”

## Optional Extensions
- Compare VR vs real-life store design cues.  
- Analyze immersive features used in gaming and apply them to retail.  
- Design a VR store concept for a new brand.
