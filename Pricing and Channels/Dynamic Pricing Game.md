# Dynamic Pricing Game

## Overview
Students play the roles of sellers and buyers in a timed simulation where demand changes over rounds.  
The activity demonstrates how **dynamic pricing**, **inventory constraints**, and **time pressure** influence pricing decisions and revenue outcomes.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how demand fluctuates over time and affects optimal pricing.
- Experience the tension between selling early vs holding inventory for higher prices later.
- Analyze the impact of limited information and competitive behavior.
- Connect dynamic pricing principles to real industries (airlines, hotels, ride-sharing).

## Materials
- Price sheets or whiteboard for tracking rounds
- Fake currency or point tokens
- Product cards (representing units of inventory)
- Round timer (phone or laptop)
- Recording worksheet for each seller and buyer

## Preparation
1. Assign roles:
   - **Sellers:** Each with limited inventory (e.g., 5–10 units)
   - **Buyers:** Each with a maximum willingness-to-pay range
2. Prepare a 5–6 round schedule with different demand levels:
   - Round 1: Low demand  
   - Round 2: Medium  
   - Round 3: High  
   - Round 4: Peak  
   - Round 5: Decline  
3. Explain rules:
   - Sellers set prices at the start of each round.  
   - Buyers purchase only if the price is ≤ their willingness to pay.  
   - Unsold inventory carries to the next round.

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Explain dynamic pricing and show examples:
- Airline tickets  
- Sports events  
- Hotels  
- Ride-sharing surge pricing  
Introduce the idea of **“price vs time vs demand.”**

### Step 2 – Round Setup (10–15 min)
Distribute:
- Product units to sellers
- Willingness-to-pay ranges to buyers
- Worksheets for recording prices and purchases

### Step 3 – Run the Game (15–40 min)
Each round lasts 2–3 minutes:
1. Sellers announce their price.  
2. Buyers decide to buy or wait.  
3. Record:
   - Units sold  
   - Revenue  
   - Remaining inventory  
4. Announce demand level for next round.  
The instructor should increase tension by speeding up rounds.

### Step 4 – Results and Comparison (40–50 min)
Groups compare:
- Total revenue  
- Inventory left unsold  
- Strategies used (high early prices vs discounting vs holding)

Discuss:
- Did sellers adjust prices quickly enough?  
- Did buyers strategically wait for lower prices?  
- Which strategies worked best under demand shifts?

### Step 5 – Debrief (50–60 min)
Connect outcomes to pricing theory:
- Intertemporal price discrimination  
- Revenue management  
- Demand uncertainty  
- Behavioral responses to pricing

Discuss real-world analogies:
- Why airline seats get more expensive closer to the flight  
- Why hotels discount last-minute rooms  
- How ride-sharing uses surge pricing

## Reflection Prompt
“What pricing strategy did you use, and how did demand shifts influence your decisions? How do these insights apply to real businesses?”

## Optional Extensions
- Add competition: multiple sellers with different inventories.  
- Hide future demand information to simulate uncertainty.  
- Introduce discounting strategies or price-matching rules.
