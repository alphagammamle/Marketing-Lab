# A/B Testing with Chocolate

## Overview
Students run a small in-class A/B test using chocolate samples to understand how **message framing**, **experiment design**, and **conversion measurement** work in marketing analytics.  
The activity demonstrates core experiment principles: random assignment, treatment effects, measurement, and interpretation.

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the logic of A/B testing and causal inference.
- Apply random assignment in a simple in-class experiment.
- Measure and interpret conversion rates for two message conditions.
- Recognize limitations and biases in small-sample marketing experiments.

## Materials
- Two types of chocolate OR one chocolate with two different message frames
- Small sample cups or individually wrapped pieces
- “Message A” and “Message B” cards (e.g., health vs indulgence framing)
- Recording sheet or online form
- Optional: projector for live result tallying

## Preparation
1. Decide on the two conditions:
   - Two **different products** (dark vs milk), or
   - One product with **two message framings** (e.g., “rich cocoa flavor” vs “guilt-free treat”).
2. Prepare labels or message cards for the two versions.
3. Create a simple data collection sheet with:
   - Condition assignment  
   - Choice/preference  
   - Liking (1–5)  
   - Purchase intent (1–5)  
4. Prepare a slide showing how A/B testing works:
   - Randomize → Expose → Measure → Compare

## Procedure

### Step 1 – Introduction (0–10 min)
Briefly explain:
- What A/B testing is  
- Why randomization matters  
- Real examples (email subject lines, ad creatives, landing pages)

### Step 2 – Random Assignment (10–15 min)
Randomly assign students to Group A or Group B:
- Even rows = Group A  
- Odd rows = Group B  
- Or use random numbers / shuffled cards  

### Step 3 – Treatment Exposure (15–25 min)
Each group receives:
- **Group A:** Chocolate + Message A  
- **Group B:** Chocolate + Message B  

Students taste the sample and complete the short response form.

### Step 4 – Data Collection (25–35 min)
Collect responses via paper or a simple Google Form.  
Tally:
- % preferring the chocolate  
- Mean liking  
- Mean purchase intent  
- Conversion rate (e.g., “Would buy this today”)

### Step 5 – Analysis (35–50 min)
Compare the outcomes between A and B:
- Did the message framing shift preference?  
- Did liking or purchase intent differ?  
- Which effect size seems meaningful (even if the sample is small)?  

Discuss confounds:
- Prior preferences  
- Peer influence  
- Sample size limitations  
- Non-random compliance  

### Step 6 – Debrief (50–60 min)
Discuss how A/B testing applies to:
- Digital ads  
- Email campaigns  
- Product pages  
- Social media content  

Introduce key concepts:
- Control vs treatment  
- Conversion  
- Statistical significance vs managerial significance  

## Reflection Prompt
“What did this experiment reveal about how small changes in messaging influence consumer choices? What limitations should marketers keep in mind when interpreting A/B test results?”

## Optional Extensions
- Test **three conditions** (A/B/C).  
- Add a **price frame** to observe willingness-to-pay.  
- Have students design their own follow-up experiment.
